    <h2>Ricardo Oscaldone</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Oscar Ricaldone, I am from Buenos Aires Argentina. I am happy to be here at BYU pursuing the chance of a higher education.</p>
    <p>We are a small family of three, my wife Valeria and my daughter Alma we always like to spend time together and enjoying our presence, it could be playing games or watching TV we always find the way to be amused.</p>
    <p>It happened to me of having jobs where I was absent from home weeks or even months. I always liked programing and in fact my whole experience always was as technician in electro mechanics, programing was a hobby about that time.</p>
    <p>In my current job I finally was able to enter the IT world as programmer, I wasn’t considered before due to my technical experience in industries and was not easy to escape from that.</p>
    <p>Being in IT as programmer was all ever wanted for so long… after the pandemic my job turned into remote, so now I can see to the pass… the doted line that our heavenly father prepared to me, he was always there! I just needed to calm down and simply go on with faith to his promises.</p>
    <p>Nice to meet you all and hoping to know more about you soon.</p>
    <p>Wish you all a good semester!</p>
